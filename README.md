# turtle-crossing-start

Step 1 - Check out how the game play works

	1. A turtle moves forwards when you press the "UP" key. It can only move forwards, not back, left or right.
	
	2. Cars are randomly generated  along the y-axis and will move from the right edge of the screen to the left edge.



Step 2 -  Break down the Problem

The First step of creating any large project is to break down the problem into smaller, bite-sized chunks. Add the following comments to the starting code and try to tackle them one-by-one.

	- Create a turtle player that starts at the bottom of the screen and listen for the "Up" keypress to move the turtle north. 
	
 
	1. Move the turtle the keypress
	2. Create and move the cars.
	3. Detect collision with car
	4. Detect when turtle reaches the other side
  5. Create a scoreboard!
